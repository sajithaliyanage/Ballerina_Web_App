Jaggery 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT_ALPHA3
-----------------

29 Mar 2013

Welcome to the Jaggery 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT_ALPHA3 release

Jaggery is a framework to write webapps and HTTP-focused web services
for all aspects of the application: front-end, communication,
Server-side logic and persistence in pure Javascript. One of the
intents of this framework is to reduce the gap between writing web
apps and web services.

This Framework uses Mozilla Rhino to process Javascript at the
server and also contains a powerful caching layer with the support of
Rhino compiled scripts; so its as fast as the JVM. As few key features,
Jaggery has native JSON support and also E4X support for XML manipulation.
